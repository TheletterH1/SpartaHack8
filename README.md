# LocoListen
LocoListen is a web application created with streamlit that connects people using their location and the music they like to listen to.

On LocoListen you can upload links to Spotify songs or playlists that you would like to share with others.
Then, the users location will be recorded to a database along with the music they chose to upload.

When users visit the website, they can view what the 10 closest albums and songs are to them in order to discover new music.
